# Sales Forecasting Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model to accurately forecast sales using historical data. Effective sales forecasting helps businesses optimize inventory, plan marketing strategies, and improve overall operational efficiency.

## Problem Statement
Sales forecasting is a critical business function that involves predicting future sales volumes based on historical sales data and other influencing factors. Accurate forecasting enables better decision-making, reducing overstock or stockouts and enhancing profitability.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of historical sales records with features such as:
- Date and time of sales  
- Product categories  
- Store locations  
- Promotional events  
- Other relevant factors impacting sales

## Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzing sales trends over time  
   - Identifying seasonality, holidays, and promotional effects  
   - Handling missing values and outliers  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Creating time-based features (e.g., day of week, month)  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Aggregating data at different granularities  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Implementing machine learning models such as Linear Regression,Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost  
   - Hyperparameter tuning  
   - Cross-validation for model robustness  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Metrics used: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
   - Comparing model performances  

## Results
- Summary of model accuracy and error metrics  
- Visualizations of predicted vs actual sales  
- Insights derived from the model  

## Business Impact
Accurate sales forecasts help optimize inventory levels, reduce costs associated with overstocking or stockouts, and improve customer satisfaction by ensuring product availability.
