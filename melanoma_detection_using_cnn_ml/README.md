# 🧠 Melanoma Detection using CNN

## 🩺 Problem Statement

Melanoma is a highly aggressive form of skin cancer that contributes to nearly **75% of skin cancer-related deaths**. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and survival. This project aims to build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** based image classification model that can **accurately detect melanoma** from dermoscopic images.

An AI-driven diagnostic tool can drastically reduce manual effort and assist dermatologists in making faster, more reliable diagnoses.
